## Local AI & LLM Development
I explore and build local AI solutions using LLM models, Ollama, embeddings, and API-driven workflows.  
My work includes designing custom AI assistants, optimizing local inference setups, and experimenting with advanced model-driven automation.

---

## Full-Stack & Web Engineering
I develop complete frontend and backend systems with a focus on clean architecture, modular design, and reliable performance.

**Core focus areas:**
- Local AI tool integration  
- Backend logic and API architecture  
- Database-driven applications  
- 3D web interfaces using Three.js  
- UI/UX with modern animation systems  
- Experimental AI-enhanced web flows  

---

## Currently Learning
- Agentic LLM workflows and autonomous AI  
- Model optimization for local inference  
- Advanced TypeScript patterns  
- Improving backend modularity and service-based architecture  
- Efficient WebGL/Three.js rendering techniques  

---

## Roadmap 2025
- Build a personal local AI assistant with modular capabilities  
- Develop an LLM-powered backend API layer  
- Create more advanced 3D web experiences  
- Improve large-scale frontend structure and performance  
- Expand full-stack project portfolio with production-ready apps  
- Publish open-source AI + Web tools for the community  

---

## Approach
I aim for clean structural design, stable development patterns, and continuous learning.  
My work is centered on solving real technical challenges and exploring modern AI and web technologies.
